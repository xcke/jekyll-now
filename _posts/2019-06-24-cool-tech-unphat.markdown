Next time you find yourself Googling some cool new technology to (re)build your architecture around, I urge you to stop and follow UNPHAT instead:

1. Don’t even start considering solutions until you **Understand** the problem. Your goal should be to “solve” the problem mostly within the problem domain, not the solution domain.
2. **eNumerate** multiple candidate solutions. Don’t just start prodding at your favorite!
3. Consider a candidate solution, then read the **Paper** if there is one.
4. Determine the **Historical** context in which the candidate solution was designed or developed.
5. Weigh **Advantages** against disadvantages. Determine what was de-prioritized to achieve what was prioritized.
6. **Think**! Soberly and humbly ponder how well this solution fits your problem. What fact would need to be different for you to change your mind? 

As described [here] :)
